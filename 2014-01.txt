    and now we're cosmic friends forever**\n - This marks the longest e-mail thread
    ever done by the Noahtrolls. We had fun.\n  - As always Marco's e-mail address
    was not correct :(\n- Tim came back to Twitter.\n - **He has a photo now. Wow.

    - Main feature of the mod are Aspects. To be continued in a full game.\n - Mod
    also contains automatic turret upgrades.\n- I wrote down my plans for the next
    year.\n- I fixed audio on my computer a bit\n - Uninstalling PulseAudio made ALSA
    work\n - Uninstalling PulseAudio didn't made JACK work, so I uninstalled JACK\n
    - **__We Scythians loathe PulseAudio.__**\n- I removed GNUstep cause while it
    was distraction-less, it was also menu-less.\n- I had a look at video materials
    for the Gimbal and they suck\n - Actresses are bad. Oh man.\n - Screenplay is
    half a nonsense. Oh maan.\n - The song the video's going to parody is way shorter
    than lyrics supplied by my teacher. Oh maaan.\n - I am responsible for making
    it look good. Oh maaaan.\n- **I used the Gimbal video materials to make a GIF
    of my friend, hehe**\n - I uploaded it to MediaCrush (https://mediacru.sh/y8Wq9dQoqtIT)
    and it's 2000% more efficent now\n  - I donated 0.0005 BTC (~$0.33) to MediaCrush
    cause they're cool.\n- Skype's Twitter was hacked by SEA, and they wrote \"don't
    use Microsoft's emails cause they're being read\".\n- In the late evening everybody
    on Twitter was talking about not talking about Sherlock to avoid spoilers."}
