    and now we're cosmic friends forever**\n - This marks the longest e-mail thread
    ever done by the Noahtrolls. We had fun.\n  - As always Marco's e-mail address
    was not correct :(\n- Tim came back to Twitter.\n - **He has a photo now. Wow.
    Such Tim.**\n- For Blechi's #NYGJ I made a Catacomb Snatch mod called Aspectable.\n
    - Main feature of the mod are Aspects. To be continued in a full game.\n - Mod
    also contains automatic turret upgrades.\n- I wrote down my plans for the next
    year.\n- I fixed audio on my computer a bit\n - Uninstalling PulseAudio made ALSA
    work\n - Uninstalling PulseAudio didn't made JACK work, so I uninstalled JACK\n
    - **__We Scythians loathe PulseAudio.__**\n- I removed GNUstep cause while it
    was distraction-less, it was also menu-less.\n- I had a look at video materials
    for the #gimbal and they suck\n - Actresses are bad. Oh man.\n - Screenplay is
    half a nonsense. Oh maan.\n - The song the video's going to parody is way shorter
    than lyrics supplied by my teacher. Oh maaan.\n - I am responsible for making
    it look good. Oh maaaan.\n- **I used the #gimbal video materials to make a GIF
    of my friend, hehe**\n - I uploaded it to MediaCrush (https://mediacru.sh/y8Wq9dQoqtIT)
    and it's 2000% more efficent now\n  - I donated 0.0005 BTC (~$0.33) to MediaCrush
    cause they're cool.\n- Skype's Twitter was hacked by SEA, and they wrote \"don't
    use Microsoft's emails cause they're being read\".\n- In the late evening everybody
    on Twitter was talking about not talking about Sherlock to avoid spoilers."}

    - A girl made a showcase of #NYGJ games on YouTube, unfortunately my game was
    called... whatever.'}

    a proper patch file.'}
4: {text: '- My brother stepped on my headphones while jumping on my sofa in an attempt
    to attack me from air. While they still work and I don''t find anything bad, dad
    says they''re so broken so they can break any minute. Shit.

    - I made a SoundCloud playlist called "Mainstream EDM @F0lis would exorcise my
    headphones for".

    - I updated youtube-dl. Wow. It''s growing fast.

    - I cleaned my phone''s SD card. Much more music fits now.

    - I decided to join #1GAM again, despite everything. Yay! (OS is too hard for
    now.)'}
5: {text: '- I watched Home Alone 5. I find it way better (that nerd guy was funny)
    than Home Alone 4.

    - I installed TTYtter and learnt to use it better than @Gallefray ;)

    - I slowly started considering wanting to get a Nintendo 3DS.

    - I emailed Owlchemy about a bug in Jack Lumber on my phone, and they replied
    in 5 minutes. They think it''s a shader problem on my Xperia.

    - I decided that I feel disgusted about how many Polish YouTube gamers open their
    own servers now

    - Played a bit of Gemini Rue, not sure what to thing about this game because it''s
    interesting but I am easily getting stuck.'}
6: {text: '- I came up with an idea to try compiling ProfMobius''s Opis mod for Minecraft
    1.7.2 so that I can have a minimap of some kind and I pretty much gave up after
    3-4 hours of downloading dependencies of MCP and MCF.

    - After totally wanting a 3DS and finding out again that Pebble exists I had a
    fight with my brain on Twitter (people loved it :D).

    - Dad said I totally can''t get a Pebble if it''s more expensive than an Ouya.'}

8: {text: "- A moron from my class pasted my face on some supersoldier body and uploaded
    the photo to our class group on Facebook. A quarter after I found it, a photo
    of him as a drill operator appeared. I also put his face in a snapshot from What
    Does The Fox Say vid, but instead of uploading it I sent it to my friends who
    may need revenge too.\n- I started playing To The Moon and I love it all.\n -
    Now I hate my life because I spent a few hours playing it instead of working on
    #gimbal video oh shit oh shit oh shit"}

    asleep on the sofa.'}
11: {text: '- I began #DefinitelyNotJam, a 6 months long game jam, in an attempt to
    make a full game.

    - I spent some time browsing Google Play for voice assistant apps that actually
    work in my country.

    - I tried starting working on #MentalWarrior but couldn''t decide how so I ended
    up starting downloading libgdx.

    - Meanwhile I started making a long mix thing song heavily inspired (at least
    in my opinion) by deadmau5 https://mediacru.sh/1vGfAl-vrVKp'}
12: {text: "- Before I went to bed I booted computer once more to download some deadmau5
    to my phone and accidentally played my new track. #ScratchTheCat suddenly turned
    her head, jumped onto my desk and started observing the speakers quietly.\n- I
    almost finished the video for #gimbal. I only need a video of a cow and ending
    titles.\n- I was on a mass at church and the old priest is good at scaring me
    away from the church. He talked radioactive waste, pilgrimages, gender ideology,
    and tons of stuff unrelated to the readings.\n- I spent some time listening to
    Studio109 radio broadcast hosted at Armoured Crow server. I found some of the
    music cool. Putting notes here to find that stuff later: https://www.facebook.com/groups/212527528894087/
    Skeleton Disco (live Studio109 session), Vacant Sun, The Inkhearts, The Gunrunners,

    Pi and take it to school and make a local radio broadcast too\". Thanks Alex."}
