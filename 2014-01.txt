    and now we're cosmic friends forever**\n - This marks the longest e-mail thread
    ever done by the Noahtrolls. We had fun.\n  - As always Marco's e-mail address
    was not correct :(\n- Tim came back to Twitter.\n - **He has a photo now. Wow.
    Such Tim.**\n- For Blechi's #NYGJ I made a Catacomb Snatch mod called Aspectable.\n
    - Main feature of the mod are Aspects. To be continued in a full game.\n - Mod
    also contains automatic turret upgrades.\n- I wrote down my plans for the next
    year.\n- I fixed audio on my computer a bit\n - Uninstalling PulseAudio made ALSA
    work\n - Uninstalling PulseAudio didn't made JACK work, so I uninstalled JACK\n
    - **__We Scythians loathe PulseAudio.__**\n- I removed GNUstep cause while it
    was distraction-less, it was also menu-less.\n- I had a look at video materials
    for the Gimbal and they suck\n - Actresses are bad. Oh man.\n - Screenplay is
    half a nonsense. Oh maan.\n - The song the video's going to parody is way shorter
    than lyrics supplied by my teacher. Oh maaan.\n - I am responsible for making
    it look good. Oh maaaan.\n- **I used the Gimbal video materials to make a GIF
    of my friend, hehe**\n - I uploaded it to MediaCrush (https://mediacru.sh/y8Wq9dQoqtIT)
    and it's 2000% more efficent now\n  - I donated 0.0005 BTC (~$0.33) to MediaCrush
    cause they're cool.\n- Skype's Twitter was hacked by SEA, and they wrote \"don't
    use Microsoft's emails cause they're being read\".\n- In the late evening everybody
    on Twitter was talking about not talking about Sherlock to avoid spoilers."}

4: {text: '- My brother stepped on my headphones while jumping on my sofa in an attempt
    to attack me from air. While they still work and I don''t find anything bad, dad
    says they''re so broken so they can break any minute. Shit.

    - I made a SoundCloud playlist called "Mainstream EDM @F0lis would exorcise my
    headphones for".

    - I updated youtube-dl. Wow. It''s growing fast.

    - I cleaned my phone''s SD card. Much more music fits now.

    - I decided to join #1GAM again, despite everything. Yay! (OS is too hard for
    now.)'}

    than Home Alone 4.

    - I installed TTYtter and learnt to use it better than @Gallefray ;)

    - I slowly started considering wanting to get a Nintendo 3DS.

    - I emailed Owlchemy about a bug in Jack Lumber on my phone, and they replied
    in 5 minutes. They think it''s a shader problem on my Xperia.

    - I decided that I feel disgusted about how many Polish YouTube gamers open their
    own servers now

    - Played a bit of Gemini Rue, not sure what to thing about this game because it''s
    interesting but I am easily getting stuck.'}

    1.7.2 so that I can have a minimap of some kind and I pretty much gave up after
    3-4 hours of downloading dependencies of MCP and MCF.

    - After totally wanting a 3DS and finding out again that Pebble exists I had a
    fight with my brain on Twitter (people loved it :D).

    - Dad said I totally can''t get a Pebble if it''s more expensive than an Ouya.'}
