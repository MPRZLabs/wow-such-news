# Wow, such news!

This project is meant to collect little notes and funny things from Michi's life.

The data will later be used on the year's end to spotlight important events.

It also serves as a blog when Michi doesn't use Twitter.

You may either read the files directly or use open source RedNotebook journal application, available for Win/OSX/Linux or something like that.
