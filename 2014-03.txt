1: {text: '- I had a nice bike trip around the county hunting for #Ingress portals
    with @Ice_panther. First one was 10 km away, we captured it quickly. Second one
    we found accidentally, passing by, couldn''t capture cause it was level 4 and
    I can only use level 2 bursters. Third one, well, we didn''t capture cause we
    got lost and then had to superquickly get home and we both got yelled at by parents.

    - I tried writing component-based gameobject system for Covenant. EP and #Fimichi
    codebase generally. It doesn''t freakin'' work... -_-

    if Double Fine use it.'}

    suggested I learn D next year together with him.\n- I had an idea to dedicate
    this month's MiniLD to Ukrainians.\n- The girl I danced with on the prom was chosen/forced/asked
    to write the article for the school paper about the prom. The impressive thing
    was that she used correct indentation. Maybe I should teach her programming in
    Python?\n- I installed Minetest and fell in love with nyan cat blocks.\n- Although
    I don't understand it, James decided to port Minecraft to Android directly.\n-

    learns Japanese. Also she's (probably) the only person in my class who doesn't
    hate manga and anime.\n - That reminded me I was gonna learn Japanese too.\n-
    #xkcd 1337 happened.\n- Transifex's CEO replied to my tweet regarding how I hate
    it. I told him more about what I find bad. I like such CEOs."}
4: {text: "- My IT teacher asked if Counter-Strike server can be hosted on Linux.
    I told him everything about Valve and Linux.\n - He let me install Counter-Strike:
    Source on one of computers as a proof.\n - He said he's talking to headmaster
    to get us a better webserver. He's aiming for a powerful little box, I hope for
    multicore.\n- I decided to start slowly replacing Facebook with Diaspora* and
    Twitter with GNU Social. On Diaspora* I'm michcioperz@flokk.no and on GNU Social/StatusNet
    I'm michcioperz@quitter.se.\n- I found out about GNU MediaGoblin but I prefer
    MediaCrush for obvious reasons.\n- Half an indie gamedev community was talking
    about Ukraine in comments under Sosowski's post on Facebook."}

    - I said I appreciate Polish teenpop fans'' stubbornness.'}
6: {text: "- Arni had a cool game idea, Turbo-Pigeon-Surfing. Actually, my classmates
    were talking about turbo-pigeons and kite-surfing, and I listened. Hehehe.\n-
    I watched the first episode of #Sherlock from my PVR and IT FREAKIN' FORGOT LAST
    15 MINUTES DAMN. I had to google google google and found the episode on Dailymotion.\n-
    I made a [site](http://allhailnoah.github.io/ThinkBumpus) for \"#ThinkBumpus Church\",
    haha.\n- I wanted to drop support for MPi framework and port Aleja Gwiazd to something.\n
    - I started with Django, it was going quite well until it came to rendering pages.\n
    - Blechi suggested Flask+Elixir and I'll consider it.\n - I got reminded why I
    made MPi. #k228's poems... -_-\n- Dad bought me a Spotify gift card. I immediately
    redeemed it and closed the browser, going #ThinkBumpus mode.\n- Later I came back
    to Quitter for a while to make a note of leaving social networks for some time.\n-
    Tim said he likes the site but suggested I don't call it a religion :D"}
7: {text: "= Main thought of the day: Lack of social networks is not good for me.
    But Spotify's worth it. =\n\n- I got reminded that this place has a potential
    for sharing stuff without social networks.\n- I decided to revive routiner.py
    cause I don't want to depend on Lift.\n - I started rewriting some parts of it
    to use Elixir cause I'm tired.\n- I watched Madagascar 3 and it is more of a spin-off
    than a sequel."}
8: {text: '= Main thought of the day: Lack of social networks no longer feels like
    something special, especially now that I have this blog-thing. =

    - I bought Ittle Dew on Ouya sale, played for 20 minutes, then remembered I have
    stuff to learn for Wednesday.

    - After unfortunate adventures with Django I decided that to make Aleja Gwiazd
    work after I leave (and to get rid of PHP) I need to build my own interpreted
    language. I called it #Ally (a pun on Aleja).'}
9: {text: '= Main thought of the day: tea is better when made using 100% hot water
    (not 50% cold 50% hot), cause you can''t drink the whole mug at once. =

    - I was reading at church. Although no one seems to have noticed, I was stressed
    and was shaking like jelly.

    - I fixed previous day''s #Ally bug by adding debugging, hehe.

    - In #Ally I changed the way of handling sites, now every site has a .allyconfig
    file with site title and stuff. Also, now directories are handled, not files.

    - I enabled Google Authenticator PAM module on LunaticArchitect64.

10: {text: "= Main thought of the day: the best way to fix my school's website is
    to put it in a subdirectory and make a totally new website in main directory.
    =\n- At school, on a break, I had a school laptop (the one in superposition, both
    hated and loved) and a junior passing by said \"nice laptop\". Haha, I don't know
    her and I don't feel like I want to. Totally not a tech person, given she said
    it's a nice laptop.\n - Y'know, it's the nicest laptop our school has, but not
    a nice one. Nice school laptops are extinct. Or something.\n- I watched Sherlock
    s01e02.\n - OH MY HE USED INTERNET EXPLORER HOW NOT TO HATE THIS SHOW AMIRITE?\n
    - No wonder that Chinese was killed so easily, she had WinXP on her laptop."}
